# Omni-Domain Autonomous Hacking Framework

## Overview

This framework provides an autonomous, multi-domain hacking system integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture. It supports automated development and execution of exploits across network, web, binary, cloud, and AI/ML domains with MCP-compliant context management, security, and evolution.

## Architecture

- **Core Framework Modules:**
  - Network Exploitation
  - Web Application Assault
  - Binary Exploitation
  - Cloud Exploitation
  - AI/ML Exploitation
  - Omni-Domain Orchestration
  - Capability Growth Engine

- **MCP Integration Modules:**
  - MCP Packet Serialization and Security
  - MCP-Compliant Attack Orchestration
  - MCP-Aware Claude API Adapter
  - MCP-Compliant Toolsmith
  - MCP Security Enforcement
  - MCP-Driven Autonomous Evolution

- **Entry Point:**
  - `main.py` integrates MCP-enabled autonomous system lifecycle.

- **Shell Scripts:**
  - `omni_execution_workflow.sh` - Integrated exploitation workflow.
  - `mcp_compliance_check.sh` - MCP compliance verification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure system dependencies for cryptography, scapy, angr, tensorflow, selenium, etc. are installed.

## Usage

Run the main autonomous system:

```bash
python3 omni_hacking_framework/main.py
```

Or execute the integrated workflow:

```bash
bash omni_hacking_framework/omni_execution_workflow.sh
```

Verify MCP compliance:

```bash
bash omni_hacking_framework/mcp_compliance_check.sh
```

## Notes

- This framework requires advanced system permissions and network access.
- Use responsibly and ethically in authorized environments only.
- MCP integration ensures context-aware, secure, and auditable autonomous hacking operations.
